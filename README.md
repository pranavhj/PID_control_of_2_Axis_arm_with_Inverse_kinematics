# PID_control_of_2_Axis_arm_with_Inverse_kinematics
TO make the code work make the connections as shown in the Initializations What the code can do?
Application of inverse kinematics using a 2 axis robotic arm
 this code will run a 2 axis robotic arm like a conventional drawing machine by drawing lines and circles at given positions 
a line can be drawn by using the function draw_line(x1,y1,x2,y2);
from points (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) a circle can be drawn by using the function draw_circle(x,y,r); which draws a circle with center as (x,y) and radius r 
We can position the end effecter accurately to any co-ordinate on the Machine by using the function goto_func(x,y)
